### Results:
**Revenue contribution and market differences:** 
- All countries contribute similarly to the global revenue (15–18%), with Australia leading and New Zealand contributing the least. However, revenue patterns differ by country, reflecting unique market behaviors and seasonal effects.

**Sales trends and seasonality:**
- Global revenue shows a decline until April, followed by a strong increase peaking in June. 
- Certain countries, such as New Zealand and the UK, experience sharp peaks likely due to large one-time orders, while others, like India and Australia, show more consistent growth.

**Product performance:** 
- Globally, the top 5 products generate over 26% of total revenue, highlighting their importance for inventory and marketing planning. They are: 'Smooth Silky Salty', '50% Dark Bites', 'White Choc', 'Peanut Butter Cubes', and 'Eclairs'.
- Customer preferences vary by region 50% Dark Bites is especially popular in Australia, while Smooth Silky Salty and Eclairs lead in India, the UK, and Canada.
- High-revenue products do not always correspond to high sales volume ('White Choc' is a key example), indicating differences in customer demand versus profitability.

**Price sensitivity:** 
- Negative correlations between price and volume across all markets indicate that chocolate sales are generally price-sensitive. 
- Australia, the USA, and Canada show the highest sensitivity, while India demonstrates more stable demand regardless of price changes.
